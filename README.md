# ðŸš€ Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization with SVD and Regression

This project focuses on optimizing **spacecraft trajectories** and **fuel consumption** using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **regression analysis** in MATLAB. It demonstrates how advanced mathematical techniques can improve spacecraft efficiency by reducing fuel usage while preserving trajectory accuracy.

## Features
- Dimensionality reduction using **SVD** for trajectory optimization.
- Manual **regression model** to predict fuel consumption rates.
- Visualization of original, optimized, and predicted fuel consumption.
- Comparison of SVD-optimized vs regression-predicted fuel consumption.
- Export of optimized trajectory and comparison results to Excel for further analysis.
- Evaluation metrics including **MAE** and **RMSE** to assess prediction accuracy.
